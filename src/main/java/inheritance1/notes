 // what are the benefits of inheritance:
    /*
    1- no repetition
    2-less coding
    3-Easy to update
    4-easy to maintenance

    - we store common class members (variables, methods) in parent classes
    - we store specific class members into child classes
    - private class members in parent class CAN NOT use by child classes
    - if child and parent class in same package child class can use default members of parent class
    - child classes can use all protected members of parent class
    - for public and protected access modifiers inheritance works without any issue
    - for private access modifier there is no inheritance
    - default members of parent can bu use by same package child classes

    - we use extends key word to get inherit from parent class. the name of this action is inheritance.
    - A parent class can have multiple child classes. Hierarchical inheritance1.
    - Multilevel inheritance supported by java.
    - Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. A child can have only one parent class.

    - down to top is a relationship
    - top to down Has A relationship

    -this() was calling to constructor inside the class itself
    -super() calls the constructor from parent
    - this. return the variables from class itself
    -super. return variables value from parent class If you have multiple variables super keyword selects closest one.
