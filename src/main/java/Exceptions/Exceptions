There two main types of exception

1- Compile time (checked exceptions)
2- run time (unchecked exceptions)

-what is the meaning if platform independent
-all exceptions are class in java

--exceptions are unexpected errors in Java
-- It can handle by using try catch blocks
-- if there is child parent relationship catch block order is important
and child should be first then parent.
-- If there is no relationship between exceptions, order is not important.
Compile time exceptions:
-- FileNotFoundException occurs in Compile Time, if there is any issue in the Path of the file or in the existence of the file
-- IOException

RunTime Exceptions:
-- NullPointerExceptions: if you do unappropriated actions with a null object you will get NullPointerException that is run time exception.
-- ArithmeticException is thrown by Java in RunTime if there is any issue in Mathematical Operations
-- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: For none existing indexes in arrays.
-- ClassCastException: if a dat atype can not be cast to another data type we will get ClassCastException.
-- NumberFormatException: If you want to convert non-digit String to int will get NumberFormatException

--it is a code block and uses in try catch
--finally block always will be executed.
-- Why we use it? To end the connection with cloud or to end connection with database or to close the file etc.
--it can be use without catch with only try. But try con not be used without catch.
-- try + finally ok but you don't want to handle the exception.
-- try +catch + finally are ok.
--try + catch or try +multiple catch+ finally are ok.

creating custom exception

--Name the class by using "Exception" word at the end. It is not must just name convention
--To create "checked exception" you should extend to "Exception" class
--create a constructor with e string parameter and inside the constructor use super()
--sometime we have to create our own exception to make our code maintenance easy.

--ERRORS can not be handled but Exception can be.
