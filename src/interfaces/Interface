Interface:
-- it is not a class, no main method in it
-- interface can contain just abstract methods, no concrete methods.
-- A method in an interface can have public access modifiers only.
-- interfaces provide fully abstractions.
Why do we need interfaces while we have abstract classes.
--Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. A class can Not have multiple parent but sometimes we need multiple parents because of that Java created Interfaces.
When do we use interfaces?
    -- If we want to create multiple parents for a class we use it
    -- interfaces are lie a to do list, if you a child class to do smth, put them into interface
    -- Interface focus on functionality not the implementations
    -- Abstract method focus on implementations not the functionality

    ** variables in interface public static and final automatically- as default
    ** All methods below are public and abstract.
