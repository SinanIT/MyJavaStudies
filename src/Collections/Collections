if something is collection it is flexible in size

COLLECTION:

1- List - (interface).List has no constructor because it is interface.
    1- ArrayList  (Class) List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    2- LinkedList  (Class) List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>(); It has multiple inheritance (Queue)

2- Queue - interface
            1- PriorityQueue  (Class)
            2- Deque (Interface)

3- Set- Interface
        1- HashSet (Class)
        2- LinkedHashSet (Class)
        3- SortedSet (Interface)
                    - TreeSet (Class)


* If you see set that means there is no duplication in elements. Elements are Uniq in every set.


** By selecting data type as OBJECT  or by not declaring data type you can store multiple data types in a collection
