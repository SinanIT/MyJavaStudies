What us the diffrence between HashMap and HashTable

-- HashMap accept NULL in Key just once and in value many times.
HASTABLE DOES NOT ACCEPT NULL IN ANYWHERE

-- HashMap is not thread safe. You can not use HashMap for multi threads. It is for single threads. USE HASHTABLE.
HASHTABLE IS THREADSAFE AND SYNCHRONIZED (SLOW)

NOTE : BOTH ARE PUT ELEMENTS IN RANDOM ORDER
