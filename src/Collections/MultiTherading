Thread means task.

It allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
Each part of such program is called a Thread
Threads can be created by using two mechanisms
1- extending Thread class
2- Implementing Runnable interface

Why do we need multithreading:
To save time Jva uses multithreading but if we doesn't organize it complicated. We need to create Synchronization

What is Synchronization:
there is locking and unlocking.
