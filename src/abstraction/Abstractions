Abstractions:

-- Abstract methods can NOT be PUT in concrete classes. Classes must be abstract.
-- When we make a "concrete class" child of abstract class we have to implement "abstract methods" otherwise will get compile time error.
-- If child class is abstract no need to override abstract methods.
-- after override we have to create our implementation
-- when we override an abstract method it should turn to  concrete methods
-- We can not create an Object by using Abstract classes.
-- An abstract class may or may not abstract method.
-- Interface focus on functionality not the implementations
-- Abstract method focus on implementations not the functionality
